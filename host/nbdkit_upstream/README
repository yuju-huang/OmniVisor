NBD — Network Block Device — is a protocol for accessing Block Devices
(hard disks and disk-like things) over a Network.

nbdkit is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

 * Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

 * Minimal dependencies for the basic server.

 * Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
   libraries or included in proprietary code.

 * Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
   Lets you export “unconventional” block devices easily.

 * You can write plugins in C, Go, Lua, Perl, Python, OCaml, Ruby,
   Rust, shell script or Tcl.

 * Filters can be stacked in front of plugins to transform the output.

For documentation, see the ‘docs/’ directory.

For plugins, examples and filters, see the ‘plugins/’ and ‘filters/’
directories.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
====================

Requirements
------------

To build the basic server and some plugins nbdkit needs nothing except
Linux, FreeBSD or OpenBSD, and:

 - GCC or Clang

 - bash

 - GNU make

Although it is possible to build without it, it’s recommended to
enable TLS (authentication and encryption) support for which you will
need:

 - gnutls >= 3.3.0

Optional dependencies
---------------------

To build the man pages, you will optionally need to install:

 - Perl

 - Pod::Man and Pod::Simple (Perl libraries)

For SELinux socket labelling support:

 - libselinux

For the gzip plugin:

 - zlib

For the xz filter:

 - liblzma

For the curl (HTTP/FTP) plugin:

 - libcurl

For the ssh plugin:

 - libssh >= 0.8.0
   (this is a different library from libssh2 - that will not work)

For the iso plugin:

 - genisoimage or mkisofs

For the floppy plugin:

 - iconv (on Linux this is built into glibc, on other systems
   it may be a separate library)

For the libvirt plugin:

 - libvirt

For the libguestfs plugin, and to run parts of the test suite:

 - libguestfs

 - guestfish (from libguestfs)

For the ext2 filter:

 - ext2fs

 - com_err

For the linuxdisk plugin:

 - mke2fs >= 1.42.10 (from e2fsprogs)

For the nbd plugin, to get URI and TLS support, and also to run parts
of the test suite:

 - libnbd >= 0.9.8

For the Perl, example4 and tar plugins:

 - perl interpreter

 - perl development libraries

 - perl modules ExtUtils::Embed, IO::File and Cwd

For the Python plugin:

 - python interpreter (version 3 only)

 - python development libraries

 - python unittest to run the test suite

For the OCaml plugin:

 - OCaml >= 4.02.2

For the Tcl plugin:

 - Tcl development library and headers

For the Lua plugin:

 - Lua development library and headers

For the Rust plugin:

 - cargo (other dependencies will be downloaded at build time)

To be able to write plugins in golang:

 - go >= 1.5

For bash tab completion:

 - bash-completion >= 1.99

To test for memory leaks (‘make check-valgrind’):

 - valgrind program and development headers

For non-essential enhancements to the test suite:

 - expect

 - ip, ss (from iproute package)

 - jq

 - losetup (from util-linux package)

 - mke2fs (from e2fsprogs)

 - nbdsh (from libnbd)

 - qemu-img, qemu-io, qemu-nbd (usually shipped with qemu)

 - sfdisk (from util-linux)

 - socat

 - ssh-keygen

 - stat (from coreutils)

Building
--------

    To build from tarball:         To build from git:
    ----------------------         ------------------
                                   autoreconf -i
    ./configure                    ./configure
    make                           make
    make check                     make check

To run nbdkit from the source directory, use the top level ./nbdkit
wrapper.  It will run nbdkit and plugins from the locally compiled
directory:

    $ ./nbdkit example1 -f -v
    ./server/nbdkit ./plugins/example1/.libs/nbdkit-example1-plugin.so -f -v
    [etc]

Optionally run this command as root to install everything:

    make install

Python
------

Since nbdkit >= 1.16, only Python >= 3.3 is supported.

By default nbdkit uses the Python version of the Python interpreter
called “python” on the current $PATH.  If you have parallel versions
of Python installed then you can choose a different version by setting
the PYTHON variable when configuring.  For example:

    ./configure PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.8

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the test suite:

    make check

If there is a failure, look at the corresponding ‘tests/*.log’ file
for debug information.

A few tests require root privileges, and are skipped by default.  To
run them you must do:

    sudo make check-root

If you have the proprietary VDDK library, you can test
nbdkit-vddk-plugin against the library like this:

    make check-vddk vddkdir=vmware-vix-disklib-distrib

DOWNLOAD TARBALLS
=================

Tarballs are available from:
http://libguestfs.org/download/nbdkit

DEVELOPERS
==========

Install the valgrind program and development headers.

Use:

    ./configure --enable-gcc-warnings --enable-valgrind

When testing use:

    make check
    make check-valgrind

For development ideas, see the TODO file.

The upstream git repository is:

Please send patches to the libguestfs mailing list:
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs

Test coverage
-------------

    ./configure CFLAGS="--coverage -g" LDFLAGS="--coverage -g"
    make clean
    make
    make check

    lcov -c -d . -o gcov.info
    genhtml -o coverage gcov.info

Open your browser and examine the coverage/ directory.  At the time of
writing (2020-04) test coverage of the server is reasonable, but
things are much worse for certain plugins and filters.
