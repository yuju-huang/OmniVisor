/* Test socket activation.
 *
 * We cannot use the test framework for this since the framework
 * always uses the -U flag which is incompatible with socket
 * activation.  Unfortunately this does mean we duplicate some code
 * from the test framework.
 *
 * It's *almost* possible to test this from a shell script
 * (cf. test-ip.sh) but as far as I can tell setting LISTEN_PID
 * correctly is impossible from shell.
