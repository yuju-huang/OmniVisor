# Regression test when next_ops->get_size changes between connections.
#
# For now, NBD does not support dynamic resize; but the file plugin
# reads size from the file system for each new connection, at which
# point the client remembers that size for the life of the connection.
#
# We are testing that connection A can still see the tail of a file,
# even when connection B is opened while the file was temporarily
# shorter.  If the actions of connection B affect the size visible
# through connection A, we didn't isolate per-connection state.
