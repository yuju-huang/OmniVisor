These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.10.
This describes the major changes since 1.8.
.PP
nbdkit 1.10.0 was released on 18th January 2019.
.SS "New features"
.IX Subsection "New features"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Implemented \f(CW\*(C`NBD_FLAG_CAN_MULTI_CONN\*(C'\fR which greatly improves
performance for clients that support it.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Implemented \f(CW\*(C`NBD_OPT_INFO\*(C'\fR (Eric Blake).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-data\-plugin\fR\|(1) and \fInbdkit\-memory\-plugin\fR\|(1): By adding
fine-grained locking, these plugins now use the fully parallel thread
model.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-cache\-filter\fR\|(1): The size of the cache can now be limited,
and the cache reclaims space using an \s-1LRU\s0 algorithm.  It has also been
enhanced to support cache-on-read mode.  The filter now uses a fully
parallel thread model.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-cow\-filter\fR\|(1): Use a fully parallel thread model.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-sh\-plugin\fR\|(1): Inline scripts:
https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2018/12/15/nbdkit\-inline\-scripts/
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-sh\-plugin\fR\|(1): Full \s-1API\s0 version 2 is now supported.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-ocaml\-plugin\fR\|(3): Full \s-1API\s0 version 2 is now supported.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-delay\-filter\fR\|(1) allows you to specify the read, write, zero
and trim delays individually.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fInbdkit\-curl\-plugin\fR\|(1): Add support for connecting to servers over
Unix domain sockets.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Bash tab completion has been improved: Partial plugin names are
expanded correctly, and plugin parameters containing \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR work.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Public header files can now be consumed by \s-1ISO C90\s0 compilers (but
\&\s-1GCC\s0 or Clang is still required to compile nbdkit itself).
.IP "\(bu" 4
A better non-cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator
(xoshiro256** 1.0) is now used on all platforms, replacing previous
uses of \fIrandom\fR\|(3).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fuzzing using American Fuzzy Lop is now supported, and was carried
out, resulting in one error being found in the server (not security
related).
.IP "\(bu" 4
New \fInbdkit\-xz\-filter\fR\|(1): This replaces nbdkit-xz-plugin which will
be removed in nbdkit 1.12.
.IP "\(bu" 4
New \fInbdkit\-loop\fR\|(1) man page documenting how to use nbdkit for loop
mounts.  See also: https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/nbdkit/
.IP "\(bu" 4
New \fInbdkit\-full\-plugin\fR\|(1): Returns \f(CW\*(C`ENOSPC\*(C'\fR on every request.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`attribute((format))\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`attribute((nonnull))\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`attribute((sentinel))\*(C'\fR are used in internal header files to improve
code quality.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Logging using \f(CW%m\fR now works on all platforms, not just on Linux with
glibc (Eric Blake).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1VPATH\s0 builds partially supported (Eric Blake).
