.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`nbdkit\-noparallel\-filter\*(C'\fR is a filter that intentionally disables
parallelism in handling requests from clients. It is mainly useful for
evaluating timing differences between various levels of parallelism.
It can also be used as a way to work around any bugs in a plugin's
claimed level of parallel support, without recompiling the plugin, or
to ease efforts when connecting with a client that can batch up
several requests but is not prepared to handle out-of-order replies.
.PP
To limit the number of concurrent clients it's usually better to use
\&\fInbdkit\-limit\-filter\fR\|(1).

.PD
Optional, controls how much serialization the filter will
enforce. Mode \fBrequests\fR (default) prevents a single client from
having more than one in-flight request, but does not prevent parallel
requests from a second connection (if the plugin supports that). Mode
\&\fBall-requests\fR is stricter, enforcing that at most one request
(regardless of connection) will be active, but does not prevent
parallel connections (if the plugin supports that). Mode
\&\fBconnections\fR is strictest, where there can be at most one client at
a time, and where the server will no longer advertise
\&\f(CW\*(C`NBD_FLAG_MULTI_CONN\*(C'\fR to clients.
