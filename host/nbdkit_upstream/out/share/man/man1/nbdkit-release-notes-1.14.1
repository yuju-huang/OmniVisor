.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.14.
This describes the major changes since 1.12.
.PP
nbdkit 1.14.0 was released on 28th August 2019.
.SS "New features"
.IX Subsection "New features"
Server performance improvements: Nagle’s algorithm is disabled;
instead \f(CW\*(C`MSG_MORE\*(C'\fR is used to control when outgoing packets are sent.
Ramdisk plugins now support more efficient zeroing.  (Eric Blake).
.PP
Plugins can now select their thread model at run time.  Thread model
selection is not finalized until after the config stage (Eric Blake).
.PP
The server supports \f(CW\*(C`NBD_CMD_CACHE\*(C'\fR for prefetching.  Plugins and
filters have been updated to implement this where it makes sense (Eric
Blake).
.PP
Low level pthread lock failures now call \fIabort\fR\|(3).  This should
never happen in real situations (Eric Blake).
.PP
The server will not advertize multi-conn support if the internal
thread model is serialized, avoiding a possible deadlock in some
clients (Eric Blake).
.PP
New server option \fI\-\-no\-sr\fR can be used to disable structured replies
(Eric Blake).
.PP
The server will now refuse to start if stdin/stdout/stderr are closed,
to avoid potential issues with file descriptor handling in plugins
(Eric Blake).
.PP
\&\f(CW$uri\fR can be used to specify an \s-1NBD URI\s0 in \fI\-\-run\fR parameters (Eric
Blake).
.PP
New \fInbdkit\-stats\-filter\fR\|(1) displays elapsed statistics about \s-1NBD\s0
operations, such as the number of bytes read and written.
.PP
New \fInbdkit\-nocache\-filter\fR\|(1) which disables cache requests, used to
determine how effective they are (Eric Blake).
.PP
New \fInbdkit\-noparallel\-filter\fR\|(1) which can be used to override the
plugin’s own choice of thread model.  Used to determine how the thread
model affects performance, or to serialize plugins if required (Eric
Blake).
.PP
New \fInbdkit\-cacheextents\-filter\fR\|(1) to cache extents requests,
especially useful with \s-1VDDK\s0 which has a slow implementation of extents
(Martin Kletzander).
.PP
In \fInbdkit\-full\-plugin\fR\|(1), \fInbdkit\-memory\-plugin\fR\|(1),
\&\fInbdkit\-null\-plugin\fR\|(1), \fInbdkit\-pattern\-plugin\fR\|(1) and
\&\fInbdkit\-random\-plugin\fR\|(1), the \f(CW\*(C`size=\*(C'\fR prefix can be omitted, ie:
\&\f(CW\*(C`nbdkit memory 1G\*(C'\fR (instead of \f(CW\*(C`size=1G\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\fInbdkit\-nbd\-plugin\fR\|(1) has multiple enhancements (all added by Eric
Blake):
.IP "\(bu" 4
It may be built using libnbd instead of constructing raw \s-1NBD\s0 packets.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`NBD_OPT_GO\*(C'\fR is supported.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Add structured reads.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Implement \f(CW\*(C`NBD_CMD_BLOCK_STATUS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Supports \s-1TCP\s0 sockets.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Forwards \f(CW\*(C`NBD_CMD_CACHE\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Retry connections.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Shared connections.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Magic \f(CW\*(C`uri\*(C'\fR parameter.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1TLS\s0 support.
.PP
\&\fInbdkit\-vddk\-plugin\fR\|(1) now reports hole extents correctly when using
the \f(CW\*(C`single\-link\*(C'\fR flag (Martin Kletzander).
.PP
\&\fInbdkit\-cache\-filter\fR\|(1) and \fInbdkit\-cow\-filter\fR\|(1) now avoid
copying data through a bounce buffer when it is already sufficiently
aligned (Eric Blake).
.PP
Filters (such as \fInbdkit\-delay\-filter\fR\|(1) and
\&\fInbdkit\-rate\-filter\fR\|(1)) which sleep no longer cause long delays when
the server is shut down (Eric Blake).
.PP
Multiple fixes to \fInbdkit\-rust\-plugin\fR\|(1) (Martin Kletzander).
.PP
Multiple enhancements and clean ups to the test suite which should
make tests better and more reliable.
.PP
OCaml plugins can now use \f(CW\*(C`parse_size\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`parse_bool\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`read_password\*(C'\fR calls, and there is also a new example plugin.
.PP
On platforms which lack atomic \f(CW\*(C`O_CLOEXEC\*(C'\fR support the most
serialized thread model is always selected to avoid leaking file
descriptors (Eric Blake).
