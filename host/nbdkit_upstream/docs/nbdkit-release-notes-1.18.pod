nbdkit-release-notes-1.18 - release notes for nbdkit 1.18

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.18.
This describes the major changes since 1.16.

nbdkit 1.18.0 was released on 27th February 2020.

=head2 Security

There were no security issues found.  All past security issues and
information about how to report new ones can be found in
L<nbdkit-security(1)>.

=head2 Plugins

New L<nbdkit-eval-plugin(1)> lets you write a plugin entirely on a
single command line.  It is similar to L<nbdkit-sh-plugin(3)>.

L<nbdkit-ext2-plugin(1)> is deprecated and will be removed in the next
release after this one (S<nbdkit 1.20>).  As a replacement use
L<nbdkit-ext2-filter(1)> like this:

 nbdkit --filter=ext2 file fs.img ext2file=/disks/disk.raw

L<nbdkit-python-plugin(3)> now offers a version 2 API which avoids
copying the data buffer, improving performance.  The original protocol
(now retrospectively called version 1) is still supported for
backwards compatibility.  The version 1 protocol was also enhanced to
support the buffer protocol for the pread method, and memoryview for
pwrite, improving performance by reducing copies (Nir Soffer).

The Python plugin now prints readable stack traces when an exception
is thrown (Nir Soffer).

New methods implemented in the Python plugin: cache, can_cache,
can_zero, can_fast_zero, can_multi_conn, can_fua.

In L<nbdkit-curl-plugin(1)>, new options C<cainfo> and C<capath>
(Wiktor Gołgowski).

L<nbdkit-split-plugin(1)> now supports extents (Eric Blake).

In L<nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)>, C<file=> is now a magic config key,
meaning it can be omitted in most circumstances (Eric Blake).

The VDDK plugin now no longer needs C<$LD_LIBRARY_PATH> to be set.
The correct library load path is automatically inferred from the
C<libdir> parameter (Eric Blake).

Verbose messages about calls to VDDK functions Read and Write can now
be suppressed by setting S<I<-D vddk.datapath=0>>.

=head2 Filters

New L<nbdkit-ext2-filter(1)>, which replaces the deprecated
nbdkit-ext2-plugin.  This filter allows you to read and write files
inside ext2, ext3 or ext4 filesystems.  The new filter has the same
features as the plugin, and one enhancement: optionally the name of
the file to serve can be picked from the client-supplied exportname.
The old plugin will be removed in S<nbdkit 1.20> (Eric Blake).

New L<nbdkit-extentlist-filter(1)> lets you specify a static list of
extents from a file which can be placed on top of plugins which don't
export extent information.

New L<nbdkit-ip-filter(1)> lets you allow and deny incoming
connections by client IP address, similar to TCP wrappers or a
firewall.

New L<nbdkit-nofilter-filter(1)> is a null filter, used for testing.

The stats filter now collects time elapsed per operation, per
operation and total rates, and adds stats for the flush method.  The
output is shown in human sizes making it easier to understand.  (Nir
Soffer).

=head2 Server

New I<--swap> option which allows nbdkit to be safely used to serve
swap space to the same machine.

Debug flags (I<-D>) can now be applied to the server core (using
S<I<-D nbdkit.*>>).  Underscores in debug flags can now be replaced by
dots, allowing a kind of namespacing.  Debug flags which are not
consumed now no longer give an error, so you can use them without
needing to detect if the plugin supports them.  New server debug flags
S<I<-D nbdkit.backend.controlpath=0>> and
S<I<-D nbdkit.backend.datapath=0>> were added to suppress some very
verbose messages when verbose mode is enabled.

=head2 API

There is a new C<.get_ready> method which is called after
C<.config_complete> and before the server forks or changes directory.
It is the last chance to do any global preparation that is needed to
serve connections.  Plugins have previously done this work in
C<.config_complete>, but by splitting this into a new method it makes
the API clearer.  (Note that existing plugins may continue to use
C<.config_complete> for this work if they prefer.)

There is a new C<.preconnect> method available which is called just
after the client makes a connection but before any NBD negotiation or
TLS authentication is done.  It can be used for early whitelisting or
rate limiting of connections, and in particular is used by the new
L<nbdkit-ip-filter(1)>.

=head2 Bug fixes

In L<nbdkit-curl-plugin(1)>, C<CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD_T> is
used (if available) so that file sizes up to 63 bits should now work
on all platforms (Pino Toscano and Adrian Ambrożewicz).

nbdkit is now compatible with OCaml 4.10.

L<nbdkit-memory-plugin(1)> now supports C<size=0> (Eric Blake).

=head2 Documentation

Plugins which were actually added in S<nbdkit 1.0.0> are now
documented as such properly.

Improved methods for probing plugins and filters are documented in
L<nbdkit-probing(1)>.

=head2 Tests

Old plugins from nbdkit 1.0, 1.2, 1.8 and 1.12 are now bundled with
the nbdkit sources and tested to try to ensure that they do not
accidentally regress.  Note these are included as binary blobs.  See
F<tests/old-plugins/README> for more information about this, including
how to delete these tests.

Various tests, especially ones which rely on timeouts, have been made
more stable so they should not fail on slow or overloaded machines.

Many tests now use libnbd and nbdsh (instead of libguestfs and
guestfish) as the test client.  This should improve the performance of
the tests for most people.

The I<--vsock> option (added in nbdkit 1.16) can now be tested if the
host is running Linux E<ge> 5.6 (Stefano Garzarella).

=head2 Build

You can use C<./configure --disable-nbd-plugin> to completely
disable the NBD plugin.

The automake feature C<subdir-objects> is no longer used, which may
improve compatibility on platforms with ancient and buggy automake
(S<RHEL 7> being one such platform).

=head2 Internals

The explicit connection parameter passed around many functions in the
server is now fetched from thread-local storage.

The server no longer calls the finalize method if prepare fails.  Also
failing to reopen the plugin from L<nbdkit-retry-filter(1)> no longer
hangs (Eric Blake).

C<git.orderfile> was enhanced to make patches easier to read (Eric
Blake).

Internal calls to methods like get_size, can_write will now no longer
produce debug messages I<if> the data is simply being returned from
the internal cache (but calls into the plugin are still logged).
