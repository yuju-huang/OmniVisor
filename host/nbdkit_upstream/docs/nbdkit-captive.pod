=head1 NAME

nbdkit-captive - run nbdkit under another process and have it
reliably cleaned up

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit PLUGIN [...] --run "CMD ARGS ..."

 nbdkit --exit-with-parent PLUGIN [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can run nbdkit under another process and have nbdkit reliably
clean up.  There are two techniques depending on whether you want
nbdkit to start the other process (L</CAPTIVE NBDKIT>), or if you want
the other process to start nbdkit (L</EXIT WITH PARENT>).  Another way
is to have nbdkit exit after the last client connection, see
L<nbdkit-exitlast-filter(1)>.

=head1 CAPTIVE NBDKIT

You can run nbdkit as a "captive process", using the I<--run> option.
This means that nbdkit runs as long as (for example) L<qemu(1)> or
L<guestfish(1)> is running.  When those exit, nbdkit is killed.

Some examples should make this clear.

To run nbdkit captive under qemu:

 nbdkit file disk.img --run 'qemu -drive file=$nbd,if=virtio'

On the qemu command line, C<$nbd> is substituted automatically with
the right NBD path so it can connect to nbdkit.  When qemu exits,
nbdkit is killed and cleaned up automatically.

Running nbdkit captive under guestfish:

 nbdkit file disk.img --run 'guestfish --format=raw -a $nbd -i'

When guestfish exits, nbdkit is killed.

The following shell variables are available in the I<--run> argument:

=over 4

=item C<$uri>

A URI that refers to the nbdkit port or socket in the preferred form
documented by the NBD project.  If nbdkit was started with the B<-e>
option to set the preferred export name, this is included in the URI.

=item C<$nbd>

An older URL that refers to the nbdkit port or socket in a manner
specific to certain tools.  This form does not include an export name,
even if B<-e> was used.

Note there is some magic here, since qemu and guestfish URLs have a
different format, so nbdkit tries to guess which you are running.  If
the magic doesn't work, try using the variables below instead.

=item C<$port>

If E<ne> "", the port number that nbdkit is listening on.

=item C<$unixsocket>

If E<ne> "", the Unix domain socket that nbdkit is listening on.

=item C<$exportname>

The default export name (which may be "") that nbdkit will advertise
in response to NBD_OPT_LIST.  This comes from the B<-e>
(B<--exportname>) command line option.

=back

I<--run> implies I<--foreground>.  It is not possible, and probably
not desirable, to have nbdkit fork into the background when using
I<--run>.

Even when running captive, nbdkit still listens on the regular TCP/IP
port, unless you specify the I<-p>/I<-U> options.  If you want a truly
private captive nbdkit, then you should create a private random
Unix socket, like this:

 nbdkit -U - plugin [args] --run '...'

=head2 Copying data in and out of plugins with captive nbdkit

Captive nbdkit + L<qemu-img(1)> can be used to copy data into and out
of nbdkit plugins.  For example L<nbdkit-example1-plugin(1)> contains
an embedded disk image.  To copy it out:

 nbdkit -U - example1 --run 'qemu-img convert $nbd disk.img'

If plugin requests have a high overhead (for example making HTTP
requests to a remote server), adding L<nbdkit-readahead-filter(1)> may
help performance:

 nbdkit -U - --filter=readahead curl https://example.com/disk.img \
        --run 'qemu-img convert $nbd disk.img'

If the source suffers from temporary network failures
L<nbdkit-retry-filter(1)> may help.

To overwrite a file inside an uncompressed tar file (the file being
overwritten must be the same size), use L<nbdkit-tar-plugin(1)> like
this:

 nbdkit -U - tar tar=data.tar file=disk.img \
   --run 'qemu-img convert -n disk.img $nbd'

=head1 EXIT WITH PARENT

The I<--exit-with-parent> option is almost the opposite of
L</CAPTIVE NBDKIT> described in the previous section.

Running nbdkit with this option, for example from a script:

 nbdkit --exit-with-parent plugin ... &

means that nbdkit will exit automatically if the parent program exits
for any reason.  This can be used to avoid complicated cleanups or
orphaned nbdkit processes.

I<--exit-with-parent> is incompatible with forking into the background
(because when we fork into the background we lose track of the parent
process).  Therefore I<-f> / I<--foreground> is implied.

This is currently implemented using a non-POSIX feature available in
S<Linux ≥ 2.1.57> and S<FreeBSD ≥ 11.2>, so it won't work on other
operating systems (patches welcome to make it work).

If the parent application is multithreaded, then (in the Linux
implementation) if the parent I<thread> exits, that will cause nbdkit
to exit.  Thus in multithreaded applications you usually want to run
C<nbdkit --exit-with-parent> only from the main thread (unless you
actually want nbdkit to exit with the thread, but that may not work
reliably on all operating systems).
