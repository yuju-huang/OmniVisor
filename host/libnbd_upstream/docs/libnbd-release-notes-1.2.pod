libnbd-release-notes-1.2 - release notes for libnbd 1.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for libnbd stable release 1.2.
This describes the major changes since 1.0.

libnbd 1.2.0 was released on 14th November 2019.

=head2 Security

Two security problems were found during development of libnbd 1.2.
Both were backported to the 1.0 stable branch.  Upgrading is highly
advisable.

=head3 CVE-2019-14842
protocol downgrade attack when using C<LIBNBD_TLS_REQUIRE>

See the full announcement and links to mitigation, tests and fixes
here:

=head2 New APIs

=over 4

=item L<nbd_can_fast_zero(3)>

Test support by the server for fast zeroing (Eric Blake).

=item L<nbd_connect_socket(3)>

=item L<nbd_aio_connect_socket(3)>

Connect to a local connected socket which you create in your main
program using your own chosen method.

=item L<nbd_connect_systemd_socket_activation(3)>

=item L<nbd_aio_connect_systemd_socket_activation(3)>

Connect to local processes that support systemd socket
activation.

=item L<nbd_connect_vsock(3)>

=item L<nbd_aio_connect_vsock(3)>

Used to connect to servers over C<AF_VSOCK>.

=item L<nbd_get_handshake_flags(3)>

=item L<nbd_set_handshake_flags(3)>

=item L<nbd_get_request_structured_replies(3)>

=item L<nbd_set_request_structured_replies(3)>

=item L<nbd_get_structured_replies_negotiated(3)>

Can be used when testing NBD servers to avoid various NBD features
(Eric Blake).

=item L<nbd_get_protocol(3)>

Get the NBD protocol variant that the server supports.

=item L<nbd_get_tls_negotiated(3)>

Did we actually negotiate a TLS connection?

=item L<nbd_set_uri_allow_local_file(3)>

=item L<nbd_set_uri_allow_tls(3)>

=item L<nbd_set_uri_allow_transports(3)>

These can be used to filter NBD URIs before calling
L<nbd_connect_uri(3)>.

=back

=head2 New features

New tool L<nbdfuse(1)> lets you create a loop-mounted file backed by
an NBD server without needing root.

C<AF_VSOCK> is now a supported protocol (thanks Stefan Hajnoczi and
Stefano Garzarella).

Support for the C<FAST_ZERO> flag (Eric Blake).

Allow disabling certain protocol features, to make it easier to test
servers (Eric Blake).

Stack-allocated Variable Length Arrays (VLAs) are now banned
throughout the library, making the library easier to consume from
threads and other small stack situations.

Reproducible builds (Chris Lamb).

Support for filtering potentially dangerous or undesirable NBD URI
features.

=head2 Documentation

Many improvements to the generated manual pages, including:

=over 4

=item *

Separate C<RETURN VALUE> and C<ERRORS> sections for each
API function.

=item *

Example code.

=item *

Relevant links can be added to the C<SEE ALSO> section.

=item *

Link to NBD URI specification where relevant, and improve
documentation around what URIs libnbd supports.

=item *

Document libnbd version number scheme.

=item *

Document limits on export name length, encoding etc.

=back

New L<libnbd-security(3)> man page listing past security issues and
remediations (Eric Blake).

=head2 Tools

L<nbdsh(1)> has a new I<--base-allocation> option which can be used to
request C<base:allocation> metadata context.

New L<nbdsh(1)> I<--uri> (I<-u>) option to connect to URIs.

=head2 Tests

You can now fuzz libnbd using either American Fuzzy Lop or clangâ€™s
libFuzzer.

Add unit tests for L<nbdsh(1)> (Eric Blake).

Improved interop testing with various NBD servers and features.

=head2 Other improvements and bug fixes

L<nbd_connect_tcp(3)> now tries to return the correct L<errno(3)> from
the underlying L<connect(2)> call when that fails.

The F<nbd-protocol.h> header file is now shared between libnbd and
nbdkit.

Better fork-safety in C<nbd_connect_*> APIs.

The code was analyzed with Coverity and various problems identified
and fixed.
