\& #include <libnbd.h>
\&

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
By default, libnbd tries to negotiate all possible handshake flags
that are also supported by the server; since omitting a handshake
flag can prevent the use of other functionality such as \s-1TLS\s0 encryption
or structured replies.  However, for integration testing, it can be
useful to reduce the set of flags supported by the client to test that
a particular server can handle various clients that were compliant to
older versions of the \s-1NBD\s0 specification.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR argument is a bitmask, including zero or more of the
following handshake flags:
.ie n .IP """LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE"" = 1" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWLIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE\fR = 1" 4
.IX Item "LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE = 1"
The server gracefully handles unknown option requests from the
client, rather than disconnecting.  Without this flag, a client
cannot safely request to use extensions such as \s-1TLS\s0 encryption or
structured replies, as the request may cause an older server to
drop the connection.
.ie n .IP """LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES"" = 2" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWLIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES\fR = 2" 4
.IX Item "LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES = 2"
If the client is forced to use \f(CW\*(C`NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME\*(C'\fR instead of
the preferred \f(CW\*(C`NBD_OPT_GO\*(C'\fR, this flag allows the server to send
fewer all-zero padding bytes over the connection.
.PP
Future \s-1NBD\s0 extensions may add further flags.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUE"
If the call is successful the function returns \f(CW0\fR.
.SH "ERRORS"
.IX Header "ERRORS"
On error \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR is returned.
.PP
Refer to \*(L"\s-1ERROR HANDLING\*(R"\s0 in \fIlibnbd\fR\|(3)
for how to get further details of the error.
.SH "HANDLE STATE"
.IX Header "HANDLE STATE"
The handle must be
newly created,
otherwise this call will return an error.
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
This function first appeared in libnbd 1.2.
.PP
If you need to test if this function is available at compile time
check if the following macro is defined:
