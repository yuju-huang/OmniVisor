# With this script you can run libnbd programs without needing to
# install libnbd first.  You just have to do for example:
#
#   ./run nbdsh
#
# or:
#
#   ./run /path/to/my/libnbd/program
#
# or:
#
#   ./run python
#   >>> import nbd    # locally-compiled nbd module
#
# This works for any C program and most non-C bindings.
#
# You can also compile other projects against this uninstalled libnbd
# tree if those projects are using pkgconf/pkg-config:
#
#   ../libnbd/run ./configure
#   make
